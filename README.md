**Project Overview**
This project is a Java program designed to demonstrate various mathematical operations and algorithms. 
It provides a menu-driven interface where users can choose from ten different tasks, each representing 
a specific mathematical operation or algorithm. The tasks include finding the minimum value in an array, 
calculating averages, checking for prime numbers, calculating factorials, finding Fibonacci numbers, 
computing powers, reversing input, checking for digits in a string, calculating binomial coefficients, 
and finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

**Building the Project**
Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Clone the project repository to your local machine or download the source code files.

**Testing and Running**
1 Each task method in the Main class corresponds to a specific functionality.
2 You can test each task individually by running the program and selecting the desired task by entering the problem number.
3 All separate inputs can be separated by space(s)
