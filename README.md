**Project Overview**
This Java project aims to showcase various mathematical operations and algorithms through a program. It offers a user-friendly interface driven by a menu, presenting ten distinct tasks representing specific mathematical operations or algorithms. These tasks encompass a range of functionalities including identifying minimum values in arrays, computing averages, verifying prime numbers, calculating factorials, determining Fibonacci numbers, evaluating powers, reversing input, searching for digits in strings, computing binomial coefficients, and finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
**Building the Project**
To begin, ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Next, either clone the project repository to your local machine or download the source code files.
**Testing and Running**
1 Each task method within the Main class corresponds to a particular functionality.
2 You can individually test each task by running the program and selecting the desired task through inputting its corresponding problem number.
3 For tasks requiring separate inputs, ensure to space them appropriately.
